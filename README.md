How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focus on clear naming conventions, modularization, and documentation. In the CRUD Python module, each database operation was separated into its own function, allowing for easy updates and reuse. This approach made connecting the module to the dashboard in Project Two straightforward and ensured future scalability for other projects, like adding new database features.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  When approaching problems like the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I first analyzed the problem, planned the architecture, and broke it down into smaller tasks. This project required integrating the CRUD operations with the dashboard, which differed from past assignments by emphasizing real-world client needs. In future projects, Iâ€™d refine my design and testing processes to ensure strength and adaptability to evolving client requests.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists solve problems by developing software that improves processes and efficiencies. My work on this project helps companies like Grazioso Salvare manage data more effectively, enabling them to streamline their operations and scale their services as needed.
